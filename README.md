# File System

University project for my OOP class

## Task
Implement a minimal file system similar to [Unix file systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem). The file system must support the most used Unix commands (for example: ls, cd, mkdir, touch etc.). In your implementation you must use Composite and Factory patterns.
